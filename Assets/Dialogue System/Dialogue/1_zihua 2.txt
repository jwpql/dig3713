[NAME=Zihua][SPEAKERSPRITE=Zihua] So you can make good tea.
[NAME=Songyun][SPEAKERSPRITE=Songyun_smileeyesclosed] Oh, I don't make it.
[NAME=Zihua][SPEAKERSPRITE=Zihua] Sorry. I meant, at least you can serve tea without purposefully adding something horrible to it.
[NAME=Songyun][SPEAKERSPRITE=Songyun_smileeyesclosed] You're always such a crybaby, Huahua~
[NAME=Zihua][SPEAKERSPRITE=Zihua] Please never, ever call me that again.
