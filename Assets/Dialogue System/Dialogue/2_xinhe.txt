[NAME=Xinhe][SPEAKERSPRITE=Xinhe]So, how was your first day as a waitress?
[NAME=Songyun][SPEAKERSPRITE=Songyun_smileeyesclosed]Honestly, not bad. Really brings back memories.
[NAME=Xinhe][SPEAKERSPRITE=Xinhe_smile]Ah. You are also from the north, no?
[NAME=Songyun][SPEAKERSPRITE=Songyun]Yep! I was trained under Madam Cui, if you've heard of her.
[NAME=Xinhe][SPEAKERSPRITE=Xinhe]Hm... she was a famous courtesan, right? 
[NAME=Songyun][SPEAKERSPRITE=Songyun_smileeyesclosed]Yep! She just runs a restaurant, now, though.
[NAME=Xinhe][SPEAKERSPRITE=Xinhe_smile]I see. As for me, I was taught by the ladies of the Zhong family, so I've never had to do anything like that.
